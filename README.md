# Journey - A Traveling Social Media App

## Purpose

Journey allows users to keep of interesting locations that they’ve been at, upload photos and videos of them while they’re there, and share them with their followers. Journeys will be user curated to show followers interesting locations they may not know about, or create an interesting “quest” for their followers to go on. Users creating a journey can also provide incentives for their followers to go on their journey, such as organizing a meetup or giving a gift card to the first person to complete their journey.
